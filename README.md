# Creative Works
## Personal Projects
-Helpful Skelly: The base art for the main player character, Skelly, as well as the multiple enemies in the game. _Helpful Skelly_ is a lighthearted and whimsical 2D pixel art platformer that takes artisitc inspiration from games such as _CrossCode_ and _Shovel Knight_ and gameplay inspiration from _Hollow Knight_ and _Ori and the Blind Forest_. The game follows a skeleton who accidentally leaves the Dark Forest and befriends a young child. He is subsequently dragged along with her through her village to help the townsfolk with various tasks. This game is targeted at the 20-35 age range and aims to capture and reignite the imagination of childhood while challenging the player with interesting gameplay.

-Asteroids VR: A game pitch I created alongside two colleagues from Full Sail University that showcases my flexibility and creativity in creating games. As a class assignment, we were tasked with creating a game pitch and proposal. _Asteroids VR_ is a virtual reality take on the original _Asteroids_ game where the player takes on the role of the gunner in the infamous triangle spaceship. The player must rotate the ship's turret to eliminate all asteroids and enemy spaceships to prevent their ship from being destroyed. The game targeted ages 20-35 who do not necessarily have much time to play games and would enjoy a nostalgic theme during gameplay. Mid_Fidelity prototype screens made with Figma.
