# About Me
I commissioned as an Officer in the United States Navy in May of 2019 and over the past six years have gained invaluable leadership and technical experience. In addition to several deployments and detachments, I have pushed myself and pursued my personal passion of creating games.

While deploying out of San Diego, CA I began teaching myself to program and familiarize myself with the Unity game engine. During this time, I began working through Unity's Game Developer learning Track, developing several small projects such as this [short 2D sidescroller]().

After working on several individual projects, I realized I needed a more structured learning experience and enrolled in Full Sail University's B.S. of Game Development in January of 2024.

I will be separating from the Navy in October 2025 and am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to develop and refine my skills in leadership, communication, and adaptability.
